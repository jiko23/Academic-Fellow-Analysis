#Academic Fellow Analysis
In recent times we might have came across news regarding illegal and criminal activities from professional from different fields of work.
The number of educated individuals participateing in such incidents has increased in recent times. These motives cannot come into a person instantly, which means they might have had it in them either from beginning(academic times) or might have developed it by looking into society could be possible. Parents plays a major role in a child's transformation. But strong beliefs can be develeoped during academic years. This project reflects my thought of how a person(mainly targeting academicians) academic as well as mental, character and thinking progress could be tracked.
If implemented from schooling times the every individul's record could be stored by schools and later can be transfered to collage/universities as well as government(if records are attached to individual's aadhar). Further record of indivial can be accessed using aadhar by organization during recruitment and further add info regarding his/her behaviour/work/etc. by HR.
This can help tracking the reason for crimes commited by an individual(mainly targeting educated) by govt.
In furthur scope for this project 'Sppech & Mood' from the Psychiatrist appointed recording could be analyzed using AI/ML.
