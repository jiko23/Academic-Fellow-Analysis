# Students-Record-Maintenance
This repo demonstrates a simplistic way to create and maintain student records for college/university.

steps:
1. Using UserRegistry code methods to add user or check existing user.
2. in terminal type: 'uvicorn Fastapi_DB_Operations:app --reload' (this starts the server)
3. after server has started go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs .Then login and perform operations.

Upcoming:
Soon I will try to add method to predict next semester score based on current semester data of a student.
